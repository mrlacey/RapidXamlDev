See and get fixes for issues in XAML files, similar to how [Rosyln Analyzers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/code-quality/roslyn-analyzers-overview?view=vs-2019) do this for C# and VB.NET code.

![Visual Studio XAML editor showing highlighted issues](#)

A number of [analyzers and fixes are provided with the tool](https://github.com/mrlacey/Rapid-XAML-Toolkit/tree/master/docs/warnings) but it also supports the ability to run [custom XAML Analyzers](./custom-analysis) that you create yourself.

The output is [fully configurable](https://github.com/mrlacey/Rapid-XAML-Toolkit/blob/master/docs/configuring-analysis.md) so warning levels can be changed or suppressed.

This functionality is [included when you **install the Toolkit**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MattLaceyLtd.RapidXamlToolkit) but can also be [installed separately](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MattLaceyLtd.RapidXamlAnalysis).

This extension includes some functionality that is dependent upon the [Common functionality](./common).
