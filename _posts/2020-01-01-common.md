Each of the other extensions also include a reference to an extension called [Rapid XAML Common Functionality](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MattLaceyLtd.RapidXamlCommon).

This package contains common infrastructure used by other extensions that are part of the Rapid XAML Toolkit. On its own this does nothing, but other packages will be missing functionality if it's not installed.

Install the [**complete Toolkit**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MattLaceyLtd.RapidXamlToolkit).
