## Show your support

These tools available for free to allow them to be used by as many people as possible. They can save you time and help you build great software. Price shouldn't be a barrier to making it easier for developers to create fantastic software.

Whether you have money or not, there are things you can do to help support the ongoing development of these tools.

### Things that you can do that don't cost money

Even if you don't have any money, there are lots of ways to support and help the growth and continuation of development.

- It only takes a few seconds to [**rate these tools**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MattLaceyLtd.RapidXamlToolkit&ssr=false#review-details). -Ratings show other potential users that you have found value from using these tools._
- If you have a little more time, please [**leave a review**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MattLaceyLtd.RapidXamlToolkit&ssr=false#review-details). _Reviews help others understand how these tools might help them. They're also a great encouragement to keep developing the tools._
- **Tell people** about the tools and how you're using them. It could be a tweet, a blog post, a talk, a podcast, or anything. Even just a chat with a co-worker.
- **Suggest new features and functionality**. [Create an issue](https://github.com/mrlacey/Rapid-XAML-Toolkit/issues/new/choose) with details of what you want, need, or would like to see.
- **Contribute** to the code, docs, or anything else. Start by commenting on, or raising an [issue](https://github.com/mrlacey/Rapid-XAML-Toolkit/issues) with details of how you'd like to get involved.


### How your money can help

While the tools are available for free, the time spent developing and maintaining them isn't. Your financial support helps ensure ongoing development and the ability to prioritize dealing with issues and questions.

If you're using these tools as part of professional development, consider paying that forward by providing financial support.
